Completely fake windows malicious file removal tool made for scam baiting purposes. 

Please have fun with it, tweak it, and just wait a moment.

Cancel button and X button won't allow the user to close.

Hit the pg-up key to immediately close the application.

I created a few scan modes:

StartScan(); //mimics normal scan
ForeverScan(); //never stops scanning - filecount increases 2000x faster
SuperSlowScan(); //normal scan with huge random delays between each file
SuperInfectedScan(); //normal scan but 1/100 files are infected
FastScan(); //scans completes in under a minute
